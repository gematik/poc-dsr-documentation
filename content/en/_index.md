Device Security Rating (DSR) is a Proof of Concept to demonstrate the secure access to services using Zero Trust design principles. In contrast to enterprise-centric Zero Trust architectures, where devices need to be owned and/or managed by a company, the DSR PoC is designed in a way that allows participants from different legal and organisational entities without the need of giving up the ownership of their devices.

The Device Security Rating PoC is an open-source project of the German National Digital Health Agency, gematik GmbH. It is part of the next generation German eHealth network [Telematics Infrastructure 2.0](https://www.gematik.de/media/gematik/Medien/Newsroom/Publikationen/Informationsmaterialien/gematik_Arena_for_digital_health_white_paper_TI_2.0_web_EN_202101.pdf) and based on the [Zero Trust concept paper](https://fachportal.gematik.de/fileadmin/Fachportal/Downloadcenter/gemKPT_Zero_Trust_V1.0.0.pdf) released in March 2023. By releasing all material to the public, gematik would like to start a dialog with the civil society and industry.
