# Welcome to the gematik contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->
 
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our projects!
 
In this guide you will get an overview how you can contribute to our projects by opening an issue, creating, reviewing and merging a pull request.
     
## Getting started
 
### Issues
 
#### Create a new issue
 
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.
 
#### Solve an issue
 
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
 
### Coding Style
 
gematik projects follow the [google style guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide) conventions. Please follow them when working on your contributions. 
 
### Commit your update
 
Commit the changes once you are happy with them.
 
### Pull Request Process
 
- When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the pull request template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers to understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link the PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Once you submit your PR, a project team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
  or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
  do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
 
### Your PR is merged!
  
Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [gematik github page](https://github.com/gematik/).
